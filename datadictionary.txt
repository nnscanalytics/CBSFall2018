Data Dictionary

Note: temp tracer, temp logger, logger = all words to describe the IoT sensor that is put on the shipments 
All of this data is for the lanes DK-> Canada and DK -> Japan. There are about 370 shipments for you to explore. We have begun gathering and joining data from other sources, but this 
data is not complete. I have also given multiple datasets of 85 shipments that have all of the information we have gathered so far form various sources.

File: ShipmentEquipmentCBS.csv
Size: 371 rows
This dataset tells basic information about each shipment, such as what equipment it is in. 

Shipping_No: This is the Novo Shipping number

Type_of_Transportation: The main mode of transportation. In this dataset they should all be Airfrieght.

Origin: Starting point of the shipment. Should always be DK in this dataset which is the Shipping Warehouse located in Greve, DK. 

Country_Of_Destination: This is the destination country of the shipment. In this dataset, this is the most specific we get in where the shipment goes in the world.

Equipment: This is what equipment the shipment was shipped in. Please see the additional file for more information about this column

Sum_Full_Pallets: For most shipments, we know how many full pallets the shipment contained

Sum_Shipperboxes: For most shipments, we know how many shipperboxes the shipment contained

File: TracerAggregateCBS.csv
Size: 5,150 rows
This dataset shows each tracer on an aggregated level. The aggregation looks at tracers and counts how many minutes each tracer is in each temperature range.
The temperature ranges we look at have been defined by our quality department.
under 0 (too cold)
0-8 (best)
8-15 
15-25
25+ (bad)

We felt this was one of the best ways to aggregate to visualize the data.


Column headings: 

Shipping_No: This is the Novo Shipping number

TT_Id: This is the ID of the temp tracer. Each Shipping_No can have multiple Tracer_Id

Type_of_Transportation: The main mode of transportation. In this dataset they should all be Airfrieght.

Origin: Starting point of the shipment. Should always be DK in this dataset which is the Shipping Warehouse located in Greve, DK.

Mission_Started: This is the first timestamp where the logger was turned on. This is not necessarily the same as the first temperature reading for this logger. 

Mission_Ended: This is the last timestamp where the logger was turned on. This is not necessarily the same as the last temperature reading for this logger. 

Product: A short description of the product inside the corresponding shipper box

Total_time_minues: The total time the tracer was recording

Deviation_time_above8_minutes: The number of minutes the tracer recorded a value above 8 degrees

This dataset shows another way we can aggregate on the tracer level. The aggregation counts the number of minutes the tracer had at each degree.

We felt this was one of the best ways to aggregate to visualize the data.

File: ShipmentAggregateCBS.csv
Size: 371 rows
This dataset shows each shipment at an aggregated level. There are many ways to aggregate, this is just one of them. Each shipment is aggregated to various temperature levels.
under 0 (too cold)
0-8 (best)
8-15 
15-25
25+ (bad)

At each category, the number of minutes listed is based on the worst tracer of the shipment in this categoy.

Example: Shipment 1
Tracer A 10 min at 0-8 5 min at 25+
Tacer B o min at 0-8 10 min at 8-15

Would be listed in the data as 
Shipment A
max_total_minutes: 15
above 8: 10
above 15: 5
above 25: 5

Mission_Ended: This is the last timestamp where the logger was turned on. This is not necessarily the same as the last temperature reading for this logger. 

Date_Time_Of_Temp: This is the timestamp of the temperature reading. All have been converted to DK time

Temp_Point: This is a counting index of what number reading this row is on the specific tracer. In this dataset it might not necessarily start at 1,
but it should always be consecutive.
