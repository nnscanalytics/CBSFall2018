# Novo Nordisk Product Supply CBC Collaboration - Fall 2018
Case and content for CBS class - fall 2018

We at Novo Nordisk are very excited to work with you this semester! We are excited to see your results! 

Case 1: What external data sources, and how, can we use the data to improve the cold chain by providing new insights. Can we find external data that further explains shipmentsâ€™ temperature patterns? 


Case 2: Using data, can we confidently conclude that a switch to a cheaper equipment is viable, keeping the same standards of compliance? Using historical data given from 2 specific lanes DK -> Japan and DK -> Canada, determine under what conditions we could dynamically switch the equipment used. 


Case 3: If it were possible to purchase a IoT device capturing any data imaginable about the shipment at any time, what benefit could be gained in transport control? How could the new data be used to optimize the cold chain in new ways? Where in the supply chain would that information be beneficial?
